## 🌟 Overview

AI4S (AI for Science / AI4Science) is the movement of using modern AI — including **foundation models**, **generative models**, **LLMs**, **multimodal models**, and **agentic systems** — to accelerate the full scientific lifecycle: hypothesis generation, experiment design, simulation, data collection, analysis, literature reasoning, and autonomous discovery.

This repository focuses on **talks** (not papers) because talks often:
- Share **early ideas** before publication.
- Provide **intuition, demos, and live systems** not captured in PDFs.
- Connect methods across disciplines (the core “AI4S” value).

> Goal: become the most complete, high-quality index of **public AI4S recordings (2018–present)**, while keeping curation standards high.

### Conventions

- **Date** format: `(YYYY-MM-DD)` when known, otherwise `(YYYY-MM)`, `(YYYY)`, or `(YYYY-??)` for approximate dates.
- **Sorting**: within each subsection, items are listed **newest-first** when possible.
- **Links**
  - 🎥 **Video**: public recording (YouTube/Vimeo/SlidesLive/conference player), or an official event page that embeds the recording.
  - 📄 **Slides**: public slide deck (PDF/PPT/Drive/official event page). Optional.
  - 📝 **Paper**: optional supporting paper/project page (arXiv/DOI/official).
- **Tags**
  - `Event: ...` — seminar/workshop/conference/series name.
  - `Discipline: ...` — Biology/Chemistry/Materials/Physics/Climate/Neuro/etc.
  - `Language: ...` — optional (`EN`, `ZH`, ...).

### Taxonomy

- **Talk Type**
  - **Keynote/Plenary**: broad, high-level talks (often conference or institute-level)
  - **Invited Talk**: invited lecture in a workshop/series
  - **Seminar**: recurring seminar series talk
  - **Tutorial**: educational / bootcamp / course-style recording
  - **Panel**: multi-speaker discussion (include moderator if known)
- **Discipline Tags** (use 1–3)
  - Biology / Life Sciences
  - Chemistry
  - Materials Science
  - Physics
  - Astronomy / Astrophysics
  - Earth / Climate / Environment
  - Neuroscience
  - Mathematics / Scientific Computing
  - Methods / Agents / Infrastructure (cross-cutting)
