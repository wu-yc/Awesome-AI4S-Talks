##  🌟 Overview

**AI4S (AI for Science / AI4Science)** refers to using modern AI (ML, deep learning, foundation models, multimodal models, LLMs, agentic systems, and scientific ML) to **accelerate scientific discovery** — including hypothesis generation, simulation/surrogates, experiment design, lab automation, inverse problems, and autonomous research loops.

This repo focuses on **talks** because:
- talks capture *fresh ideas* earlier than papers,
- they provide **context + intuition**, and
- they are the best “entry points” for new researchers.

### Curation Principles
- ✅ High signal-to-noise, reputable venues/hosts
- ✅ Prefer **public video recordings** (YouTube/Vimeo/conference player)
- ✅ Add slides when available
- ✅ Tag by discipline + method
- ❌ Avoid low-effort reposts / clickbait
- ❌ Avoid paywalled-only content (unless widely useful & clearly labeled)
